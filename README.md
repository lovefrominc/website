<h2>Open source</h2>
<p>
Our website is now open source to let web designers improve the website itself. This is a open source project partnered with <a href="https://opensource.org">Open Source Initiative</a>. <br><br>
For over 20 years the Open Source Initiative (OSI) has worked to raise awareness and adoption of open source software, and build bridges between open source communities of practice. As a global non-profit, the OSI champions software freedom in society through education, collaboration, and infrastructure, stewarding the Open Source Definition (OSD), and preventing abuse of the ideals and ethos inherent to the open source movement.
<br><br>
Open source software is made by many people and distributed under an OSD-compliant license which grants all the rights to use, study, change, and share the software in modified and unmodified form. Software freedom is essential to enabling community development of open source software.
<br><br>
LoveFrom Inc. and the Open Source Initiative will reward a scholarship to the web designer who makes the best improvements.
